	<p>This is Yash! I'm currently working as a Data Scientist @ <a href="https://www.gumlet.com/" target="_blank">Gumlet</a> with 4+ years of experience in the field of Data Science especially in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. I've also wrote a python tool called <a href="https://github.com/yash1994/dframcy" target="_blank">Dframcy</a>, a light-weight utility module to integrate <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">Pandas Dataframe</a> to <a href="https://spacy.io/" target="_blank">spaCy's</a> linguistic annotation and training tasks. Also, I am a connoisseur Hollywood movies and tv-series (you will find some references throughout my posts &#x1F920;), and Dota 2 player &#127918;.
